# kraken2_report_analyser
Kraken2 Report Analyser is a Python-based tool for parsing, restructuring, and summarizing kraken2 report output into biologically meaningful, analysis-ready tables and Excel workbook
The tool reconstructs the full taxonomic hierarchy from Kraken2 reports, computes accurate abundance and relative abundance metrics, and generates domain(Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, Virus) and rank-specific(Domain, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) outputs suitable for downstream analysis, visualization, and reporting.

This project is designed as a lightweight, extensible alternative to R/Shiny-based tools such as Pavian, with a focus on transparency, reproducibility, and pipeline integration.
